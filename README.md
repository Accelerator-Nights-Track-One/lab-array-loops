# JavaScript Looping Over Arrays Drills

In this section, you'll practice using loops to iterate over arrays. You'll write programs that solve common problems by accessing and manipulating array elements using `for` and `while` loops.

### Instructions:
In **loops.js** for each prompt, write a JavaScript program that solves the problem by looping over the given array. Make sure to run the program in your terminal to check if it works as expected.

---

## For Loops

1. **Print Array Elements**  
   Write a program that prints each element of an array on a new line.

2. **Sum of Array**  
   Write a program that calculates and prints the sum of all numbers in an array.

3. **Find the Maximum**  
   Write a program that finds the maximum number in an array.

4. **Find the Minimum**  
   Write a program that finds the minimum number in an array.

5. **Even Numbers Only**  
   Write a program that prints all even numbers from an array.

6. **Odd Numbers Only**  
   Write a program that prints all odd numbers from an array.

7. **Reverse Array**  
   Write a program that prints the elements of an array in reverse order without using the built-in reverse method.

8. **Print First Half**  
   Write a program that prints the first half of an array.

9. **Print Last Half**  
   Write a program that prints the second half of an array.

10. **Count Specific Element**  
    Write a program that counts how many times a specific number appears in an array.

11. **Check for Duplicates**  
    Write a program that checks if an array contains any duplicate values.

12. **Array Length**  
    Write a program that calculates and prints the length of an array.

13. **Array Elements to String**  
    Write a program that joins all the elements of an array into a single string, with each element separated by a comma.

14. **Find Element Index**  
    Write a program that finds the index of a specific element in an array and prints it.

15. **Filter Array**  
    Write a program that filters out all elements less than 10 from an array and prints the new array.

## While Loops

16. **Print Array Elements with While Loop**  
    Write a program that prints each element of an array using a `while` loop.

17. **Sum of Array with While Loop**  
    Write a program that calculates and prints the sum of all numbers in an array using a `while` loop.

18. **Find the Maximum with While Loop**  
    Write a program that finds the maximum number in an array using a `while` loop.

19. **Find the Minimum with While Loop**  
    Write a program that finds the minimum number in an array using a `while` loop.

20. **Double Array Values**  
    Write a program that doubles each value in an array and prints the modified array.
